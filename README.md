# 2120-Project
Testing searching and sorting algorithm time efficiency in C++

# Compilation
Compile searchSortMain.cpp on the target machine with the other C++ files in the same directory.  The timing function currently has linux dependencies with no Windows alternative.

# Execution
Execute the binary with the input .txt files in the same directory so that the program can read from them.
